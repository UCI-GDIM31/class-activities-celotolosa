Hello World!

### W2
1.The r, g, and b variable are floats because these values are fractions and not whole numbers, true or false, or text. 
2.The _bounce variable is an int because it's value is a whole number, and bounces the same way every single time, hence _bounce++;
3.The error that I got after step X of Part 2 reminded me to use a semicolon at the end of the line of code I made. This is similar to punctuation and is necessary for the computer to understand what I'm trying to code in order for it to work properly

### W3
Table #18
Table answer:

void SetLightDimness (float x) {
    float light = 100 * x
}
Since the method is not being returned, it starts with void. The parameter is the sanity level of the player which is multiplied by 100 and stored in a light variable to adjust the ingame light accordingly.

The relationship between classes and components are like a tree. The scene makes up a game, which is made up of game objects, which have components. A component can be a script which is made up of classes which can be defined as a monobehaviour. In classes, methods are defined and called within which have variables and sets of code.

The balls get extremely bright because the ball is getting multiplied by a brightness multiplier
