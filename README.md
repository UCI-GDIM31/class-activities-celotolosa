Hello World!

### W2
1.The r, g, and b variable are floats because these values are fractions and not whole numbers, true or false, or text. 
2.The _bounce variable is an int because it's value is a whole number, and bounces the same way every single time, hence _bounce++;
3.The error that I got after step X of Part 2 reminded me to use a semicolon at the end of the line of code I made. This is similar to punctuation and is necessary for the computer to understand what I'm trying to code in order for it to work properly
